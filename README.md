# professional-portfolio

This is my first project that I wrote the code from scratch. By using the knowledge I have attained to so far, my goal was to create a responsive professional protfolio to house my future projects and contact information. As time goes on, I know this will gontinue to evolve but it was important for me to focus on creating a solid foundation of code to build on.
